# 10Bagger
10Bagger is a stock research app. The user can create an account for themself and then have access to the apps research capabilities. A search bar allows the user to type in a stock ticker and get the latest price for the stock along with information on the company's sector, an overview of what the company does, along with a few basic numbers such as 52-week highs and lows and P/E ratio. The user also has access to the company's most recent annual income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement. The user can then create a "watchlist" that they can add the stock to if they want to follow it and continue to research the company. 

# USERS STORIES
- I want an app that allows me to put in a stock ticker symbol or a company name and have it return some basic information: current price, 52-wk high, 52-wk low, percent change for the day, dollar change for the day.
- I want to be able to create multiple “watchlists” where I can save lists of stocks along with some basic data that's associated with them. 
- I want to access these lists after I log in, with the press of a button.
- I want the data associated with the stock, such as it's current price and daily percentage change to update at the press of an "update" button. 
- I want a password-protected log-in feature.
- I want to be able to logout.

# STRETCH GOALS
- I want to be able to reset my password if I forget it. -- STRETCH GOAL
- I want to have my username sent to the email that I have on file if I forget it.
- I want to set a "target price" for a stock and have the app send me an alert if its hit.
- I want to play a game where I can create an imaginary “Portfolio” that tracks the gains and losses of each individual stock and the portfolio as a whole.
- I want my Portfolio to track the stock info much like the watchlist, but I also want it to keep track of how many shares that I own as well as my average price per share, total return, daily return, and percentage return.
- I want the game to calculate dividends and add them to my portfolio earnings.
