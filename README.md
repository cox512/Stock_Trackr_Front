A stock/financial portfolio tracking app -- front end

# USERS STORIES
- I want an app that I can put in a stock ticker symbol or a company name and have it return some basic information: current price, 52-wk high, 52-wk low, percent change for the day, dollar change for the day.
- I want to be able to create multiple “watchlists” where I can save stocks. 
- I want to access these lists after I log in, with the press of a button. 
- I want a password-protected log-in feature
- I want to play a game where I can create an imaginary “Portfolio” that tracks the gains and losses of each individual stock and the portfolio as a whole.
- I want my Portfolio to track the stock info much like the watchlist, but I also want it to keep track of how many shares that I own as well as my average price per share, total return, daily return, and percentage return
- I want to be able to pull up company info for my selected stocks from the SEC web site.
