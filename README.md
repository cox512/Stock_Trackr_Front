A stock/financial portfolio tracking app -- front end

# USERS STORIES
- I want an app that allows me to put in a stock ticker symbol or a company name and have it return some basic information: current price, 52-wk high, 52-wk low, percent change for the day, dollar change for the day.
- I want to be able to create multiple “watchlists” where I can save lists of stocks along with some basic data that's associated with them. 
- I want to access these lists after I log in, with the press of a button.
- I want the data associated with the stock, such as it's current price and daily percentage change to update at the press of an "update" button. 
- I want a password-protected log-in feature.
- I want to be able to logout.
- *I want to be able to reset my password if I forget it. -- STRETCH GOAL*

- *I want to play a game where I can create an imaginary “Portfolio” that tracks the gains and losses of each individual stock and the portfolio as a whole. -- STRETCH GOAL*
- *I want my Portfolio to track the stock info much like the watchlist, but I also want it to keep track of how many shares that I own as well as my average price per share, total return, daily return, and percentage return -- STRETCH GOAL*
